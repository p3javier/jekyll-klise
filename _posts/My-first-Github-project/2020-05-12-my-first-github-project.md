Hello dear reader, if you are here is because you are interested in my person. Here you'll find a little about who I am and why I've created this website. Welcome.



### How I have entered into this world üíª

I think that the roots of my current love to code are years before I learn my first programming language*, at the university. From my childhood I've been always curious about science and technology (apart from of course the things that every child like). 

Unluckily, I come from a **humble family**. I grew up in a working class neighbourhood in **C√≥rdoba (Spain)**. Back to these days my parents didn't have money to buy me a computer, not to mention an Internet connection that was very expensive at that time (early 2000s).

The next step in my love story with the technology came on **2010** when, finally, my parents had money to install Internet on my home. Yes, you've read correctly, **until 2010 I didn't have a personal Internet connection**. This was the beginning of a new era in my story.

\* _It was Python 2.X._

### Internet, the beginning of a *new era* üåê

It's May 2010 and the a *new era* begins for me, it was the era of **Internet**.

Honestly back to those days I didn't use to take the same advantage of Internet as nowadays, where even I depend economically of it. All of what I used on Internet was the usually every teenager:
1. Play online video games.
1. Play music.
1. Watch films.
1. Also watch other kind of films...

But quickly my passion for the technology brought me to other kind of more interesting things on Internet. YouTube, Wikipedia and many more sites were loaded with tons of precious content just there, free, for me.



### Before Code */Anno ex codice* ‚å®Ô∏è

Not was until 2012 that I have my first encounter with code, it was with a programming language that was turning very popular back to those days, Python. I'll never forget that first line of code:

```python
print "Hello, World"
```
But not was until I've started the university that I had the first serious encounter with coding, with Python again.

Learn to code at the university (though the degree not was CS) allows me to learn the basis of every computer language. I mean Boolean algebra, conditionals, loops, recursiveness, etc.

### Improving the skills üë®‚Äçüíª

The next step in my adventure to coding came in 2018, when I decided to dig deeper into coding.

Around late 2018 a friend told me that a company called [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/en/madrid "Ironhack"), in Madrid, was organizing a "competition" to give grants to the best performers. The problem was that in less than 2 weeks would take place the competition in Madrid and the problems should be coded in **JavaScript**, a language totally new for me.

Luckily for me, they included a link to [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) as a resource to learn JavaScript and be ready for the test. I need to say that this is probably the best free bootcamp that you can find on the net, so it's 100% recommended by me.

Finally the day of the test arrived and I had managed to get on time from C√≥rdoba  to Madrid and one more important thing, I just have a desktop PC at that time and the test was [**BYOD**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device "check the meaning at Wikipedia"). So, a few days before I was looking for rent a decent laptop in Madrid and I found a guy that precisely had a company focused on rent professional devices like laptops.

I did the test among in a place that easily was hosting 300+ people to do that test, at that time I thought that there isn't any possibility for me to get even a partial grant. But finally, I managed to solve the problem of count the number of **leap years between 0 AD and today** and before that many of the people that were there competing too.

Two weeks later I received an email from this school, unluckily for me they just granted me a partial grant of 2000‚Ç¨ instead the full grant of 7000‚Ç¨, that wasn't enough for me taking into account that I also will need to pay the cost of living in Madrid while the course was on going. :(

Anyway, I was amazed with the freeCodeCamp bootcamp and I decided to continue with it.

The next step in my adventure was the key factor that brings me to this point but that's matter of another post...
